# ShiftCodeGenerator
This is a small application that I created sometime in the middle of 2013, before I left my last company. It was used to automate and speed up the generation of our shift codes corresponding to our daily attendance (time in/out) records, prior to submission to our HR department for payroll processing. Initially, this was created only our team's use (Hardware Development Section). 

But eventually, I modified it to extend the capability to generate for other teams (SW Dev, SW Validation, Electro-mechanical teams, etc). Unfortunately, this is only usable with MS Excel.

This my first program written in C#, using MS Visual Studio. I relied on my programming experience with Sybase PowerBuilder 10 when I created this application. Thankfully, The transition was manageable and the attempt to use C# was successful.
