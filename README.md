# ShiftCodeGenerator
This was a small application that I created sometime in June 2013, before I left my last company. It was used to automate and speed up the generation of our shift codes corresponding to our daily attendance records (time in/out) , prior to submission to our HR Department for payroll processing. Initially, a form was passed and each employee had to manually input his/her shift codes for each day corresponding to the attendance/payroll period. This program was my proposal to eliminate that tedious process.

Initially, this was created only for our team's use (Hardware Development Section). But eventually, I modified it to extend the capability to generate for other teams as well - SW Development, SW Validation, Electro-Mechanical teams, etc. Unfortunately, this was only usable with MS Excel.

Using MS Visual Studio, this was the first program that I wrote in C#. I relied on my programming experience with Sybase PowerBuilder 10 when I created this application. Thankfully, the transition was manageable and the attempt to use C# was successful, at least for this purpose.
